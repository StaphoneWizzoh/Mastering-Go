PACKAGES:
    They are mainly used for grouping related functions, variables, and constants so that they can be transfered and used easily in a Go program.

    Go packages need to be called directly or indirectly from a `main` package in order to be used.

    The init() function is executed only once.

FUNCTIONS:
    1. Anonymous Functions(closures): Used for implementing things that require a small amount of code, can be defined inline without the need of a name.

    2. Go allows one to name the return values of a Go function.

    3. A function can take pointer parameters provided that its signature allows it.

    4. Go functions can either return other functions or accept functions as parameters. The most common uses of the latter case is for sorting elements and filepath.Walk() function.
    
    5. Variadic Functions: Are functions that accept a variable number of arguments.

PRIVATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS:
    Functions, variables, types and so forth that begin with an uppercase letter are public, whereas those that begin with a lowercase letter are private.
